    "The problem (ill-posed) is the following : we want to estimate the voxels of the HR image from the pixels of the low resolution image. To make it simpler, we can model the LR data as an average of the surrounding HR pixels :\n",

    "The idea would then be to estimate the $x_i$ from the $y_j$, but we can see that there will be infinite values that will meet this condition. So we could first add a regularization term to limit the number of solutions, but regularization is known for destroying the high frequency content of the results, which is what we'd like to obtain.\n",

Then, correct the voxels values so that they fit with the original LR data"
